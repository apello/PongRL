## Overview

This a personal project that trains an agent to play Pong. I constructed the game using Pygame, and used Pytorch to create a model and train the agent.

## Setting Up Development Environment 

First, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/apello/PongRL.git
```

Secondly, create and activate a Python virtal environment to run your code in:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Thirdly, install the necessary libraries and dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Lastly, open the agent.py file and run it.
